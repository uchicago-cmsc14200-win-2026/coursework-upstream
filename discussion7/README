CMSC 14200 Winter 2026
Discussion 7
February 17 and 18, 2026

This exercise will acquaint you with the method
`pygame.key.get_pressed()` which will enable your application to react
to keys that are held down and furthermore react to multiple keys held
down.

In the accompanying `assets` directory, you will find images of a
walking character that are frames in an animated sequence. These are
named `walk0.bmp`,`walk1.bmp`, and so on up to `walk7.bmp`. There is
also an image of the same character not walking; this is called
`idle.bmp`. Last but not least, there is a background image of a
desert scene named `desert.bmp`. The character images are from a
website of free game assets called `kenney.nl` (recommended!) and the
desert image is a creation of Nano Banana.

To learn how to use pygame's `get_pressed` method, please take a look
at the sample program `colors.py`. The get_pressed method returns a
sequence* of booleans indexed by pygame key constants. The following
code checks if the a key is pressed at a particular moment:

*It is neither a list nor a tuple, but a custom object supporting
 subscripting.

    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_a]:
        # code...

To check if both a and b were being pressed at the same time, one
could write

    if keys[pygame.K_a] and keys[pygame.K_b]:

Using `get_pressed` represents a different model than what we have
been following in pygame programming up to this point. Rather then
reacting to a user's having struck a key as we do when checking for a
key event, `get_pressed` asks for the current state of the keyboard at
that moment in time as opposed to waiting for an event. It is an
active rather than passive engagement with the keyboard, in other
words.

Review the `colors.py` code. Once, from reading the code, you
understand what it does, run it and try it out.

Once you understand `colors.py`, try completing the code in
`walker.py`. The comments in that file explain what needs to be
done. Once the code is complete, the character will walk left and
right at two different speeds as outlined in the comments.

(There is no quiz today, just this exercise.)
