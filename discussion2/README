CMSC 14200 Winter 2026
Discussion 2
January 13 and 14, 2026

This is an ungraded exercise whose purpose is to help you learn some
of the foundations of programming interactive games. There is no due
date for this programming task and no score associated with it -- it's
just to increase your skills (and it's fun to see it working).

Please review this whole document before diving in and writing code.

You may work with another person on this task if you like. Please stay
completely away from LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude; using any such tool
would defeat the purpose of this work.

The coding task is to build a dice-rolling toolkit that could be used
to implement games like Yahtzee. The app will allow you to roll five
dice, and reroll some or all of the dice as desired. You will use a
software framework called *pygame* to do this. Pygame is a Python
toolkit that is especially good for constructing games, but it's not
only for games; any application you want to build that involves
graphics and real-time interactions (for example, a calculator, a
graphing calculator, a stopwatch) could be written as a pygame app.

Along with this README, this directory contains the file `quitter.py`,
which is a sort of level-0 pygame application. All one can do with
quitter application is quit[*] it, so it is not itself useful, but you
can and should use it as a starting point for other pygame
applications. Take a close look at the code in quitter and try to
understand the methods written there.

[*] You quit by clicking on the window's quit button, which has a
different appearance and location depending on the platform the app is
run on. (For example, on a Mac, the quit button is a red circle in a
window's upper left corner.)

To begin, from within the discussion2 directory, run

  $ cp quitter.py roller.py

The roller app, is, at first, identical to the quitter app.

In `roller.py`, change the name of the class Quitter to Roller.

The first modest extension to Roller should be to enable the lowercase
q key to quit the app. To do this, you will need to place this
conditional in the right location in the event loop:

  if event.key == pygame.K_q:
      self.quit_app()

Actions are attached to other keys similarly (elif event.key ==
pygame.K_r, etc.). Notice that the constant `pygame.K_q` is the way to
refer to the q key on the keyboard; the full list of pygame key
constants is at https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html.

The roller application must clearly display five dice in a row from
left to right. The roller application should implement the following
keystroke behavior:

- q should quit
- r should roll/reroll the dice
- 1 should freeze/unfreeze the leftmost die
- 2 should freeze/unfreeze the next-to-leftmost die
- 3 should freeze/unfreeze the middle die
- 4 should freeze/unfreeze the next-to-rightmost die
- 5 should freeze/unfreeze the rightmost die

To draw dice, you will need to know how to draw circles and rectangles
in pygame.

To draw circles, use pygame.draw.circle, as in

  pygame.draw.circle(surface, color, center, radius)

For example:

  pygame.draw.circle(self.surface, (0,0,0), (100,80), 30)

Note that you can draw an outline circle (not a solid circle) by
adding a named argument `width`, as in

  pygame.draw.circle(self.surface, (0,0,0), (100,80), 30, width=3)

If the presence of this width argument, the outline of a circle will
be drawn using the given value as the width of that outline.

To draw a rectangle,

  pygame.draw.rect(surface, color, rect)

The third parameter here, notated `rect`, must be a pygame Rect
object, whose constructor takes (left, right, width, height), each an
integer, in that order. For example:

  pygame.draw.rect(self.surface, (0,0,100), Rect(20,30,300,100))

You can also add a named width argument to this call to draw an
outline (not filled-in) rectangle.

See these links for more information on circles and rectangles:

  https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.circle
  https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.rect

To maintain the status of five dice, you will need to add certain
attributes to the Roller class. In our prototype implementation, we
store a list of five numbers for the values on the faces of the five
dice, and a list of five bools to keep track of which dice are
currently frozen or not.

This is just enough information for you to implement Roller. Think
about how to shape the code; you have many choices to make. Ask lots
of questions and enjoy!
