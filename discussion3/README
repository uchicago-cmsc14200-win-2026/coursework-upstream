CMSC 14200 Winter 2026
Discussion 3
January 20 and 21, 2026

Completing this (ungraded) exercise will take you further in the
direction of being able to build interactive games.

Please review this whole document before writing code. You may work
with another person on this task if you like. Please stay completely
away from LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude; using any such tool would
defeat the purpose of the work.

The coding task is to be able to calculate whether a disc in a field
of discs has been clicked on or not. Please watch the demonstration
video (on Panopto) to see how your application should behave.

Pulling from the upstream repository will supply you with

- clickdiscs.py, a framework for the code, and

- an assets directory containing some relevant images (look inside
  it).

====== RESPONDING TO CLICKS

When the player/user clicks on the pygame window, a `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`
event happens. Immediately thereafter, the (x,y) position of the click
is available in the variable `event.pos`, which is a pair of integers
(a `tuple[int,int]`, in mypy terms). You will need to use `event.pos`
to determine whether or not you have clicked on a disc.

====== DRAWING

A refresher: to draw circles, use pygame.draw.circle, as in

  pygame.draw.circle(surface, color, center, radius)

For example:

  pygame.draw.circle(self.surface, (0,0,0), (100,80), 30)

There are "letter tiles" in `assets` that you can use as labels for
the discs. The letter tiles are images in the bmp (bitmag) format,
which seems to be the most convenient one for pygame.

To draw an image on a pygame surface, the commands are

  img = pygame.image.load([filename])
  surface.blit(img,[position])

For example, to draw the light blue A tile from assets on the screen,

  dir = "assets/images/letter-tiles"
  img = pygame.image.load(dir+"/letter_lightblue_uppercase_A.bmp")
  surface.blit(img,(0,0))  

(The variable `dir` here is used only to break up what would be a very
long string.) The `blit` method of the surface draws the image
argument on that surface, with the coordinate argument as the
upper-left corner of the drawn image. "Blit" is an old-school computer
programming abbreviation for "bit-block transfer" and is a verb used
in graphics programming.

You will notice that the letter tiles, as given, are too large for
this GUI's window size; you can scale them to different size(s) using
the function `pygame.transform.scale_by`, as in

  dir = "assets/images/letter-tiles"
  img = pygame.image.load(dir+"/letter_lightblue_uppercase_A.bmp")
  img = pygame.transform.scale_by(img,0.5) # the image is now half the size
  surface.blit(img,(0,0))  

Your GUI should present nine discs, A through I, on the screen. When
you click on the screen, if you clicked within any disc (anywhere
within the radius of that disc, not just on its center), the app
should print a corresponding message to the terminal. If a click is on
no disc at all, that should also be printed to the terminal.

This exercise, not coincidentally, has substantial overlap with one of
your in-flight homework tasks. Enjoy the work and happy hacking!
