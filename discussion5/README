This week, you will use pygame and a terminal-printing library called
rich to generate "terminal mosaics" from photograph inputs.

First, a few words about the rich library. It is possible to print
colorful text in the terminal, as well as to print in bold, italic,
etc. This can be done with cumbersome codes that look like "\033[1m"
and "\033[3m"; these are functional, but not user-friendly in any
sense. Rich allows styles terminal printing to be done in a
user-friendly way by constructing HTML-like strings specifying the
desired characteristics in plain language. Try the following commands
in a Python shell:

>>> import rich
>>> rich.print("[italic]APPLE[/italic]")
>>> rich.print("[bold]BANANA[/bold]")
>>> rich.print("[rgb(255,165,0)]CARROT[/]")
>>> rich.print("[italic bold rgb(255,165,0)]DAMN![/]")

It is possible not only to specify a foreground text color but also a
background color, as in

>>> rich.print("[white on red]FEBRUARY 2026[/]")

Note that very common colors like white and red can be referred to by
name, whilst colors that are not among the most common ones (as in
CARROT above) can be specified as RGB triples.

In order to print a quasi-pixel to the terminal, one can "print" a
space with an (irrelevant) foreground color and a substantive
background color, as in

>>> rich.print("[white on blue] [/]")

This prints a blue block, although given the geometry of terminal
printing, it's a tall rectangle. To get a closer-to-square building
block, print *two* spaces, as in

>>> rich.print("[white on blue]  [/]")

You have been provided with a framework for a mosaic maker
application. You should implement the method `mosaic` that is given a
tile size (a mosaic granularity), analyzes the input image, tile by
tile, computing average colors for each, and printing corresponding
"pixels" in the terminal to create an impressionistic echo of the
original image.

You will need the `get_at` method from pygame, as in

color = self.surface.get_at((x,y))

The `get_at` method returns a pygame Color object, which has
attributes `r`, `g` and `b`.

(https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_at)

Your `mosaic` method should contain some kind of loop or nested loops
that walk over the "tiles" in the original image, sampling the colors
to compute the mean color of each tile, and write that average color
to the terminal using `rich.print` and the techniques above. Feel free
to experiment with different tile sizes and different photographs. You
will enjoy the results of this when you see them!
